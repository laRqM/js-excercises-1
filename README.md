# JavaScript excercises
JavaScript's beginners exercises about programming logic. It supports interaction from the user using the HTML DOM and console only code. It uses Bootstrap 5 for the HTML.

Kindly reminder that this is the code from a beginner of JavaScript. Of course, it contains code that can be improved. I'm still learning, like everyone else üò¨

It has 27 excecises:

The exercise 27:

Program a class called Peliculas.

The class will receive an object at the time of instantiation with the following data: id of the movie in IMDB, title, director, year of release, country or countries of origin, genres and rating in IMBD.
